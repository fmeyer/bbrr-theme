If you‚Äôre a screenwriter, try my new [Roam Screenwriter](https://github.com/linuz90/roam-screenwriter) theme.

# How to use

1. Inside Roam Research, create a page named exactly `roam/css`

2. Create a `[[Better Roam Research]]` bullet point.

3. Create a child **code block** inside it (you can write three backticks to create it: ```) and change it to **css**

4. Paste this in the code block `@import url("https://linuz90.github.io/better-roam-research/src/css/main.css");`

It will look like this:

The theme will change when I push updates in this repo ‚ö°Ô∏è

# Editing this theme

To create this theme I'm using the **SCSS** syntax. This file is compiled into a regular **CSS** file used for the theme.

To edit the theme, install [Ruby Sass](https://github.com/sass/ruby-sass) (it's not maintained anymore, will use something else in the future).

Then compile the SASS using this command:

`sass --sourcemap=none --no-cache --watch ./main.scss:./main.css`
